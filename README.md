#DESCRIPTION

This Python script retrieves and visualizes weather forecast data for Mumbai using the OpenWeatherMap API. It starts by importing necessary libraries such as requests for making API calls, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs, seaborn for enhancing visualization, and datetime for converting timestamps into readable date formats. The script defines an API key and constructs a request URL to fetch weather data in metric units. Upon sending a request, the script extracts key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed from the JSON response. These values are stored in separate lists along with their corresponding timestamps. Using Matplotlib, the script generates a dashboard comprising three line charts: one for temperature trends, another for humidity variations, and the last one for wind speed changes. Seaborn is used to enhance the appearance of these plots, and timestamps are formatted for better readability. Finally, the graphs are displayed in a well-structured layout using plt.tight_layout(), allowing users to analyze weather patterns effectively over time.
